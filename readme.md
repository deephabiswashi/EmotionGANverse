# EmotionGANverse

A unified deep learning project implementing and comparing four powerful Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models: **DCGAN**, **CGAN**, **BigGAN**, and **StarGAN**. Each model is developed from scratch using Tensorflow, enabling high-quality image generation and facial expression transformation.

## 🧠 Model Overview

### ✨ DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)

* **Purpose**: Learn to generate realistic images from random noise using convolutional layers.
* **Highlights**: Built from scratch, uses batch normalization, LeakyReLU, and transposed convolutions.
* **Output**: Sampled images of a specific domain after training.

### 😊 CGAN (Conditional GAN)

* **Purpose**: Generate facial expressions based on emotion labels (happy, sad, angry).
* **Highlights**: Trained on FER-2013 dataset, includes condition vectors, works for emotion-to-face mapping.
* **Output**: Transformed facial images based on given expressions.

### 🔥 BigGAN

* **Purpose**: Class-conditional high-resolution image generation.
* **Highlights**: Uses large-scale training and improved class embeddings, known for superior image quality.
* **Output**: Image samples of diverse categories with better quality.

### 🚀 StarGAN

* **Purpose**: Multi-domain facial attribute and expression translation.
* **Highlights**: A single model handles transformations across multiple emotion domains.
* **Output**: Original face converted into different emotions like happy, sad, angry.

## 🎯 Use Cases

* Facial expression editing for image apps
* Emotion synthesis for avatars and virtual agents
* Conditional image generation for creative AI
* Benchmarking different GAN architectures

## 📅 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
