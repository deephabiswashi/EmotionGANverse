# EmotionGANverse

A unified deep learning project implementing and comparing four powerful Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models: **DCGAN**, **CGAN**, **BigGAN**, and **StarGAN**. Each model is developed from scratch using Tensorflow, enabling high-quality image generation and facial expression transformation.

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

### âœ¨ DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)

* **Purpose**: Learn to generate realistic images from random noise using convolutional layers.
* **Highlights**: Built from scratch, uses batch normalization, LeakyReLU, and transposed convolutions.
* **Output**: Sampled images of a specific domain after training.

### ðŸ˜Š CGAN (Conditional GAN)

* **Purpose**: Generate facial expressions based on emotion labels (happy, sad, angry).
* **Highlights**: Trained on FER-2013 dataset, includes condition vectors, works for emotion-to-face mapping.
* **Output**: Transformed facial images based on given expressions.

### ðŸ”¥ BigGAN

* **Purpose**: Class-conditional high-resolution image generation.
* **Highlights**: Uses large-scale training and improved class embeddings, known for superior image quality.
* **Output**: Image samples of diverse categories with better quality.

### ðŸš€ StarGAN

* **Purpose**: Multi-domain facial attribute and expression translation.
* **Highlights**: A single model handles transformations across multiple emotion domains.
* **Output**: Original face converted into different emotions like happy, sad, angry.

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases

* Facial expression editing for image apps
* Emotion synthesis for avatars and virtual agents
* Conditional image generation for creative AI
* Benchmarking different GAN architectures

## ðŸ“… Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deephabiswashi/EmotionGANverse.git
cd EmotionGANverse
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train Models

Each model has its own `train.py`:

```bash
cd CGAN
python train.py
```

### 4. Run Inference

```bash
cd CGAN
python run_inference.py
```

## ðŸ“Š Sample Results

* Generated faces with varying emotions
* Realistic outputs from BigGAN and StarGAN
* DCGAN-generated digits or faces depending on dataset used
